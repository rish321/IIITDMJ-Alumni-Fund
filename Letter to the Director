Subject: Regarding initiation of Alumni Fund.

Dear Ma'am,
  Now that 6 UG and 4 PG batches have successfully passed out from the college, some of the alumni were interested to contribute to the institution growth through alumni fund.
Are there any existing funds/infrastructure/possibilities for the alumni to contribute and track the usage of funds?
Because the institute is very new, we are assuming that no such facility is existant. Thus we propose to set-up an alumni fund for the betterement of students, infrastructure, and our alma-mater in general.
However, there are a some questions which are more or less in everyone's mind:
1. How can we directly talk to the college authorities regarding this?
2. How soon can we initiate this fund?
3. Who would set-up the alumni account?
4. Who will formulate the policy regarding the usage of fund?
5. How can the alumni track the usage of their fund?
6. Who will head this fund from the authorities side?
7. How can we involve the current students to help us set-up the fund?
8. How can we ensure proper utilization of the funds in the areas we intend to?
Please reply to these as soon as possible so that we can start with other formalities. Also please feel free to ask any question or clrification regarding the fund.
PS: This is a completely volunteer effort from the alumni and no one can be forced to comply with their policies.

Thanking you,
Yours Sincerely,
IIIT-DM Alumni Fund Committee.
